        Use this area to introduce your mission. I'm a researcher in structural engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence and computational modelling. My work explores advanced deep learning and hybrid machine learning methods for predicting the behavior of steel and concrete structures.
  
        I aim to bridge structural engineering and AI to develop resilient and sustainable infrastructure.
